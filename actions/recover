# Recover from a majority failure in an etcd cluster
# This action should be run after failed units are removed.
# The basic flow is as follows:
# 1. Change etcd config file to start a new cluster from
#    scratch which allows new units to be added to cluster
# 2. Restart the etcd service (which also starts a new cluster)
# 3. Change config back to how it started
# After these steps, added units will join the cluster as expected
