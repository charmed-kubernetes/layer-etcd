# Snapshot a running etcd cluster data.
# This command will rewrite some of the metadata contained in the backup
# (specifically, the node ID and cluster ID), which means that the node will
# lose its former identity. In order to recreate a cluster from the backup, you
# will need to start a new, single-node cluster. The metadata is rewritten to
# prevent the new node from inadvertently being joined onto an existing cluster.
