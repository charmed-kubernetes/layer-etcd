    default: auto
    description: |
      The snap channel from which to install etcd (e.g. '3.3/stable'), or 'auto'
      to accept the charm default. Choosing 'auto' will install the latest 
      supported version of etcd at deploy time, but will not automatically upgrade
      to a newer version thereafter.

      How often snapd handles updates for installed snaps. Set to an empty
      string to check 4x per day. Set to "max" (the default) to check once per
